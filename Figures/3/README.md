#Figure 4

Figure 4 performs emringer analysis on dose-fractionated maps of the T20S proteasome using a single static model to understand the effects of radiation damage on individual side-chains.


*Only a few dose-fractionated files are included here for filesize reasons (github prefers to have filesizes under 1 GB). (Email the authors)[mailto:ben.barad@ucsf.edu] for raw data. Pickles output directly from `emringer.py` are in the `Pickles` folder*
