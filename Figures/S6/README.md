# Figure S6

Figure S6 was figure 3 in the preprint. It describes the progress of rosetta iterative rebuilding in refining the EM structure of TrpV1.

I did not supply the trajectories used here publicly because they are the data of Ray Wang; however, if you want to recapitulate these figures then I will be happy to supply them via email!

## Usage
```bash
set TRAJECTORIES="~/Projects/EMRinger/Figures/S6/trajectories"
./S6A_prep.sh
python S6A.py
```

Others are fairly self-explanatory based on the previous figures...
