# EMRinger
*All of the scripts used in the EMRinger paper were based on [Phenix](www.phenix-online.org), [python](www.python.org), and [pymol](www.pymol.org)*

### Calculating EMRinger Scores
If you would like to calculate EMRinger scores, check out the `Phenix_Scripts` folder for more detailed instructions. Feel free to [email the authors](mailto:ben.barad@ucsf.edu) if you would like help running the scripts or want to troubleshoot any issues.

### Recapitulating the Figures
Ultimately, every figure used in the EMRinger paper should be recalculable by a user interested in investigating the tool. Currently, only some of the figure generation scripts have been packaged nicely, but feel free to check out the `Figures` folder to see my progress on that front. If there is a figure in the manuscript that you really want to try to generate with your own data, [email the authors](mailto:ben.barad@ucsf.edu) and we'll be more than happy to share the not-as-cleaned-up scripts we used.

## Requirements

Pymol Incentive 1.7.4
